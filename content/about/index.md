I was born and raised in London and I'm of Nigerian descent.

I'm a Software Engineer by trade — Bachelors in Computer Science from [RHUL]("https://cs.rhul.ac.uk/") —  with approximately two years industry experience.  Currently studying for an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning @ [UCL]("http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/current_students/specialist_msc_programmes/msc_dsml/").

Some of my current research interests include: 

- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Affective computing for physiological monitoring.
- Structural Bioinformatics.
- Psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.
- AI Safety & Ethics.

The goal of this site is to serve as “homepage”, meaning I want it to encapsulate anything I wish to share about my life, professional & personal.

Feel free to [reach out to me][1]; I'll try and respond within a couple days.
