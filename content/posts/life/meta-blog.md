I don’t really know, to be honest.

I’ve never really been into writing. I find that it takes me too long and personally, I just don’t think I’m good at it.

Having said that, I do believe I have a pretty unique perspective, so it would be a shame not to share at least some parts of it.

Back to answering the original question: I guess you can call this a _Tech blog_? Well, I suppose it depends on your definition of a Tech blog. To clarify, I don’t really plan on doing product reviews/unboxing’s or anything like that — you’re more likely to see setup guides, tutorials, career insights, and code walkthroughs.

So, about that "unique perspective":

- For starters, I _personally_ don’t know of too many black software engineer’s.
- In my everyday life I rarely interact with "techies", which isn’t by design; it just happens to be the way my environment is set up 🤷🏾‍♂️
	- To Illustrate, I didn’t have the slightest clue of what Computer Science or programming was until I studied it during my undergrad 😅
- My cognitive style (basically, the way I think) is non-traditional, which I promise you is __not__ a fancy(/fake-humble) way of saying "I think out of the box".  Put simply, I’ve recently learnt I have various learning "_difficulties_" — I’ll probably touch on some of these in a future post.

In essence, my main aim for this blog is to provide exposure to technology (specifically, computer science, programming, and machine learning) to an audience who otherwise wouldn’t have any (easily accessible) means. Also, given my cognitive difference, I’ll try to provide insight into some of the ways I’ve tackled/learnt these topics, that you may not have seen elsewhere.

As always, you can reach me via any of my socials or email, all linked on the [homepage](https://momoh.sh/ "homepage").

Lastly, if you see this post is really old and I haven’t followed through on any of the above, please hold me to account in the comments below!
