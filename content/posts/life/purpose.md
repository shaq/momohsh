Framing.

In a perfect world, I would only work on things because of (at least) one of the two following reasons:

* For the beauty of it. The way that particular thing would make me feel.
* The potential benefits to society, my community, my family -- in reality, anything bigger than myself.

Note, both reasons are pertaining to solving some kind of problem; a problem in which one could foresee an end, i.e., a solution, not necessarily optimal. Although the second seems far more altruistic than the first, both are inherently selfish pursuits. It goes without saying, but for completeness: I would never consciously put any positive effort towards anything purposefully conceived to harm others.
