These days, I barely know what's going on. Probably only watched around 30 matches in the last 3 years. I'm too far removed.

Need to kick ball again sometime soon. It was one of the things I looked forward to when I was recovering from my surgery ... It's been over a year since I could and I've only done it twice ðŸ˜£
