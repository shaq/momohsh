 A react application consists of components  Components are independent, isolated and resuable. Each component is a piece of UI.  Every react application has at least one component - the root. React applications are represented as a tree of components. Components are usually implemented as js class that consists of a state and a render() method.  The state is the data we want to display when the component is rendered The render method describes what the UI should look like.</description>
